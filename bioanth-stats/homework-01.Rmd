Create a repository in your ***GitHub*** account called "AN597-Week-2", and upload an **RMarkdown** (Rmd) file - you can create one using the 'new file' button on the editor in ***RStudio*** - with your notes and code for all of the CHALLENGES from Module 04, which you'll be trying on your own this week.

ALSO, please make sure that you've been able to PUSH that file up to ***GitHub*** from ***R*** (it should be accessible in your GitHub account. Notes in Module 03 should help you accomplish this - and, of course, feel free to come see me for additional help if you're having problems).

Some of you will no doubt realize that you will be able to see your colleagues' **Rmd** documents on ***GitHub*** each time they push them up, if you check out their accounts... I encourage you to troubleshoot code together, but please refrain from copying each others' work - in person or from repositories - and **make your work your own**!
